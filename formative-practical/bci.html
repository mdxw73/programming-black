          <h5>Summary</h5>
          <p>A Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is the use of hardware and software to enable a brain to control peripherals and perceive electrical signals. BCI systems are split into 4 phases: preprocessing, feature extraction, signal classifications, and control. In this article, I will be outlining the key roles of each of these processes and how they interact with one another; then giving an example of the incredible impact that this technology can have on people with neuromuscular disorders.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Preprocessing</h5>
          <p>In machine learning, a feature is an individual property of an observable phenomenon that can be measured. A set of such features can be described by a feature vector which is then used as an input to the machine learning algorithm. Preprocessing is concerned with constructing feature vectors from raw data using preprocessing algorithms.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Feature Extraction</h5>
          <p>Feature extraction is concerned with reducing the dimensionality of the data; however, it uses algorithms that operate in a different way to feature selection. These algorithms repeatedly manipulate the data that was outputted by the preprocessing stages to find a representation that uses fewer variables and is still sufficiently accurate.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Signal Classification</h5>
          <p>Classification is the broadest term so far and describes any technique that can be used to predict the class/category of given data points. The most common example of a classifier is a spam detection program in email service providers which is used to filter spam emails out of your inbox and move them to the spam folder. This phase is concerned with using the results from training to determine what class the input data might belong to.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Control</h5>
          <p>Finally, the control phase is the branch of machine learning concerned with changing the environment/real world in such a way that the signal classification will be changed into a desirable state. This phase, often referred to as intelligent control, uses artificial intelligence techniques such as neural networks and evolutionary computation to discern what inputs are required to get the desired output and in turn makes changes to fit these needs.</p>
          <h5 class="mt-5">Impact of BCI</h5>
          <p>On April 23rd, 2020, a team of researchers in the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Centre announced that they had successfully restored sensation to the hand of a 28-year-old participant with a severe spinal cord injury using a BCI system. The system enhances weak neural signals thereby improving motor ability and perception. The system uses haptic feedback, commonly known for its use in phones and controllers, to amplify signals from the skin to the brain. This was only possible because some fibers of the patient’s spinal cord remained intact. There was a signal being transmitted via the central nervous system, but the signal was so weak it wasn’t perceived by the brain. This is the case with the majority of spinal cord injuries and so this technology has a huge potential for changing the lives of many and boasts new possibilities for the future of this field of data science.</p>
