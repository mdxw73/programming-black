Interest of content- Excellent:

Unique and interesting examples to use. Wide variety of topics which sufficient interesting information and facts.

Consistency and quality of visual presentation- Excellent:

Very consistent between pages, same style, fonts and buttons/containers used. Home page is a bit inconsistent with the rest of the website though

Quality of written presentation- Very good:

Very high standard, each page however has a different level of understanding required to read. For example the archaeology page is very easy to read without any prerequisite knowledge however the brain computer interface page requires some understanding already 

Validity of HTML- Excellent:

HTML is written to a good standard. Stylesheet is separated- good use of bootstrap elements and no clutter in the HTML.

Evidence of collaboration- Very good:

Each person seemed to contribute a fairly equal amount- some pages are shorter than others. Consistent style and layout suggests strong collaboration between users in the group. Author boxes have been filled out by each other. Commit history shows it was not done last minute and has been steadily worked on instead of rushed
